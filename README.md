# API3Swap

## Vision

API3Swap aims to create a scalable DeFi system with multiple functionalities, focusing on a minimalist approach to escrow services for secure and transparent transactions.

## Description

API3Swap is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built for the API3 hackathon. The project provides an escrow account system that allows two parties (buyer and seller) to come to a consensus for executing transfers or transactions based on predefined conditions, primarily related to the price of BIT (Mantle) & Matic (Polygon) cryptocurrency.

## Features

- Escrow Account: Users can interact with the smart contract to place orders, and funds are transferred only when the specified conditions are met.

- Real-Time Price Data: API3Swap utilizes API3's web API and amberdata to fetch real-time price data for Matic/USDT pair to execute the escrow conditions.

- Wallet Integration: Users can connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the API3Swap's escrow contract seamlessly.
